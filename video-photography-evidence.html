          <h3>Photography Basics</h3>
          <p>When it comes to photography, there is a lot more to consider when taking a photo than just point and shoot. For example, we learned how important it is to find the perfect location that offers the best lighting for your photos. The majority of my photos were taken outside and I took full advantage of the sunlight to get the best possible lighting for my photos. The weather also played an important role as different weathers can have an effect on the feel of the photo. For example, if the weather is rainy then the photo will appear more dark and dull. However, if the weather is sunny then the photo will appear more vibrant and colorful. Furthermore, it is also important to think about the positioning of the photo. When taking my photos, I found that I didn’t want the background to be the focal point of the photo so I positioned my model more center framed and used depth of field to blur out the background noise so that all the attention would be on the model. According to Prakel (2006) “The best photographic images combine technical excellence with strong composition.” </p>

          <h3>Video Production Basics</h3>
          <p>Where photography is solely focused on an individual image, video production is much more complex and dynamic and I found that you have consider a lot more when recording a video. Such as the audio, editing and the overall production quality of the video. In our video, which we were recording for MOTDx, we found the sound to be a slight issue especially when recording outside. We had to have multiple retakes of the same shot just to make sure the sound was crisp and clear. We also had to make sure that the framing and composition was spot on so we could capture every angle of the footage. As we were recording a football video it was important to make sure we had multiple cameras set up around the pitch to make sure we had every angle covered. Furthermore, we had to consider the location and which day we would film on. Because we were recording a football video we had to find a pitch that we were allowed to film on plus we had to organise a day where we were all available to film and the weather was good to record. According to Millerson (2013) “Skilful lighting allows you to adjust and manipulate the impression conveyed on the screen.”</p>

          <h3>Social Media Delivery Format</h3>
          <p>For our social media video, we took one of the highlight clips from our actual video and changed the sizing format to suit the platform which we would post it on. The social media platform we decided to post it on was TikTok as we feel like our video is perfect for the app and the type of content that you would find on the app. Very short and snappy but also very humorous. According to Basch (2020) TikTok has “800 million users worldwide” which shows just how popular the app has become recently and why it’s important that companies take advantage of engagement through social media. One of the issues we found was trying to format our clip to fit the size required for the app. We recorded our main video in landscape mode and for TikTok we had to change it to portrait mode. By doing this we struggled with resizing the video and found that it cut off parts of our video just to fit the frame. When editing the clip for social media, we had to change it slightly from the clip in the original video to make it more fun and more appealing to the audience as it is only a short clip.</p>
