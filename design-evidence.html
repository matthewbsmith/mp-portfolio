            <h3>Color Theory</h3>
            <p>When creating a website, the different variations of color is very important as this can help to create a more professional looking website that appeals to employers. It is very important that the color scheme used is in coordination with the background image and the overall layout of the website to make sure that the website looks professional and clean. Whereas, a poorly chosen color scheme that doesn’t match with the background image will make the website look tacky and rushed. Color can also have an affect psychologically as certain colors can be linked to different human emotions. For example, the color red is associated with anger and passion whereas yellow is associated with warmth and brightness. For my website, I chose to go with a baby blue color scheme on certain texts as it matches with my background image and the overall theme and layout of my website which makes it look more visible and easier to read while also maintaining that professional look. According to Ionel (2010) “A web designer must use color in an efficient way that will present, on the internet, information, services, organizations and products.”</p>

            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <p>Similarly to Color theory, typography is just as important when it comes to web design as the right choice of font can help to make your website more professional and sleek. It is also important as the website is designed for employers, that the font is easy to read and looks good visually. The typography also needs to follow the theme of the website and it needs to be suitable to the overall layout of the website. For the general typography on my website, I chose the font ‘Source Sans Pro’ as I think its sleek design fits in well with the overall theme of my website and making it look more professional. According to Harkins (2010) “Good typographic design communicates appropriately in accordance with the demands placed upon it. The practice of typographic layout must balance the necessity of communication alongside aesthetic sensibilities. It must be informed by an understanding of convention and tradition, whilst demonstrating skill, judgement and taste in accordance with the zeitgeist. In short, the typographic designer can be seen as an arbiter of the visualization of language.”</p>

            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p>As well as looking professional, the website also has to be laid out in a way that is easily accessible and easy to navigate around. Thus, making the website available for audiences to access with ease, especially those who may suffer with more complex website layouts or for those who may have a disability that impacts their ability to use technology at high standard and complexity. When making a web design we tend to focus more on how the website looks rather than how easy it is to use. It is important that we focus on both so that the website looks the part but also acts the part. According to Hackett (2007) “Websites were retrospectively analysed to study the effects that technological advances in web design have had on accessibility for persons with disabilities.” She found that “US government websites remain accessible while increasing in complexity. Increasing complexity, often caused by adding complex components to a webpage, doesn’t have to contribute to increasing barriers to accessibility.” This shows that even when web design improves and becomes more complex, it is still possible to make it accessible and easy to manoeuvre around.</p>
